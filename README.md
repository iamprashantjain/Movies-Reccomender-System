This project is about building a movie recommendation system. The system uses a dataset of movies, including information like overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew. It preprocesses the data, extracts relevant features, and converts them into vectors. The similarity between movies is calculated using cosine similarity. The resulting model can recommend similar movies based on a user's input. The entire project includes data preprocessing, model building, and ultimately creating a website for users to get movie recommendations. The model and necessary data are saved using the pickle module for future use in the website.
